"""Build a parlay from per-leg ensemble projections.

Thin orchestration: for each requested leg (pitcher, line, side, book odds) it
asks the ensemble pipeline for that pitcher's projection, pulls the model
probability for the chosen side, then hands the assembled legs to the pure
:func:`app.model.parlay.evaluate_parlay`. The projections are the foundation;
this module just composes them — it adds no new modelling.
