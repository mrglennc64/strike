"""Fetch + parse the free MLB Stats API into the model's input shapes.

Coverage vs. the 7 projection factors (see ``app.model.inputs``):

  Covered by this free-API layer (5 of 7):
    1. Opponent K% vs RHP/LHP        -> statSplits sitCodes vr/vl
    2. Opponent K% last 14d / 30d    -> byDateRange windows
    3. Pitcher recent form (Ks/K9)   -> pitching gameLog
    4. Expected workload (innings)   -> season IP / games started
    5. Tonight's lineup K%           -> schedule ``lineups`` hydration

  NOT available from the MLB Stats API (need Baseball Savant later, 2 of 7):
    6. Swinging-strike % / CSW%      -> left as ``None`` (model degrades to neutral)
    7. Pitch-mix vs opponent whiff%  -> ``pitch_mix`` left ``None``

Umpire data is also outside this API, so ``umpire`` is left ``None``.

Rates are returned as fractions in [0, 1]: K% = strikeOuts / plateAppearances.
