"""The daily parlay matrix — a STAKING structure layered on capital control.

Given a hard daily budget (from :mod:`app.model.bankroll`) and the day's +EV card
legs (one per game, independent by construction), this splits the budget across a
small / medium / large tier and builds the best parlay for each tier's leg band.

Design stance (deliberate, and at odds with the "8-12 leg lottery" pitch):

  * **Legs are hard-capped at 6** (``MAX_MATRIX_LEGS``). An 8-12 leg parlay of
    ~40-55% legs has a joint win probability around 0.01-0.07% — it hits roughly
    once a *decade*, not once a month, and after the book's compounded vig it is a
    ~-45% EV ticket. We do not build them.
  * **+EV tiers must clear +EV.** The small and medium tiers only stake a parlay
    whose EV is positive; if today's legs can't form one, the tier is skipped and
    its budget is left unspent (protect capital over forcing action).
  * **The large tier is an explicit variance bucket.** It may stake a -EV "moonshot,"
    but it is FLAGGED as such — it is entertainment/variance, not expected profit.

The honest bottom line, surfaced in the output: a parlay multiplies per-leg edge
*and* the per-leg vig. If the legs have no proven edge (CLV unconfirmed), every
tier is -EV and the matrix only controls how fast the budget bleeds. This builds
the structure; proven edge is still the prerequisite for profit.
