"""Closing Line Value (CLV) — the sharp's truth metric.

You only know a model has real edge if it consistently bets at better prices than the
market's *closing* line. We can't reconstruct history, so closing lines must be captured
going forward: run ``capture_closing_lines`` shortly before first pitch (e.g. via cron),
then ``clv_for_side`` compares the price we logged against the close.

CLV here is measured in de-vigged probability: positive means the closing market implied
a HIGHER probability for our side than the price we took — i.e. we bought low. Good.
