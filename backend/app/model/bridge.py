"""Bridge the v2 ensemble projection into the Poisson/edge/insight betting stack.

The ensemble in :mod:`app.model.projection` produces a richer expected-Ks
(``lambda``) from recent form, tonight's actual lineup, expected innings, the
home-plate umpire, manager hook and pitch mix. This module feeds that lambda
into the *existing* probability + edge + Kelly + insight machinery
(:mod:`app.model.poisson`, :mod:`app.model.edge`, :mod:`app.model.insight`), so
we keep the predictive inputs of the framework AND the rigorous de-vigged
staking of the original pipeline — one model end to end.

This is the "bridge" that unifies the two model tracks: instead of computing
lambda from season K/9 x multipliers, the betting stack now consumes the
ensemble's lambda. Output shape matches ``pipeline.predict_pitcher`` so it is a
drop-in for the API/pipeline.
